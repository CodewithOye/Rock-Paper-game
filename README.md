# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows you to play against the computer, and also includes an autoplay feature that lets the computer play against itself.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. You will see three buttons: Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Click on one of these buttons to make your move.
3. After making your move, the computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The result of the game will be displayed on the screen. If you win, the screen will show "You win!" If you lose, it will show "You lose!" And if it's a tie, it will display "It's a tie!".
5. You can click the "Play Again" button to reset the game and play another round.

## Autoplay Feature

If you want to see the game played automatically between the computer and itself, you can click the "Autoplay" button. The game will then start playing rounds without any input from you. To stop the autoplay, simply click the "Stop" button.

## Files

The game consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the game interface and buttons.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the appearance of the game interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the game logic and handles user interaction.

## Credits

This game was created by Code With Oye. It is a simple project intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building interactive web applications.
